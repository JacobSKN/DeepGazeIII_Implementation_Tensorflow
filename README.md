# DeepGaze III Implementation Tensorflow

In this repository, one can find a implementation of the DeepGaze III algorithm (from KÃ¼mmerer et al. (2022)) in python 3.7 using tensorflow 2.x. This repository is part of a master thesis project done by Jacob Schildknecht.

The project is still in progress.
